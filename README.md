# Facebook Friend Recommendation System

The goal of this project is to develop some algorithms that would be useful in a recommender system. These algorithms are meant to be tested on a graph dataset of facebook users, found in "facebook_combined.txt". This file has data from the “ego:facebook” Social Networks dataset, from the Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection. Our project uses the Hierholzer's Eulerian Path and Tarjan's Strongly Connected Components algorithms to generate recommended friends. To run the code, run "make && ./main".
