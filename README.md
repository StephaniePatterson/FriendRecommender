# Hello! Welcome to our CS 225 final project! 

The goal of our project is to develop some algorithms that would be useful in a recommender system. These algorithms are meant to be tested on a graph dataset of facebook users, found in "facebook_combined.txt". While our work is still in progress at the moment, you can clone the repository and run "make && ./main" to see our data reader and BFS algorithm in action!
